# ⚖️ LLM Response Evaluator

![Tests](https://github.com/ivanedens55-web/llm-response-evaluator/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A Streamlit app that compares two AI responses to the same prompt and scores them against a rubric, using Google Gemini as the judge. It includes an optional position-bias check that re-runs the judgement with the responses swapped and flags it when the verdict changes.

Built to show structured LLM evaluation in practice: rubric-based scoring, schema-validated JSON output, and a simple guard against one of the best-known weaknesses of LLM judges.

## Features

- Paste a prompt and two responses, and get a 1–5 score per criterion for each response, a winner, and the judge's reasoning
- Five built-in criteria (Accuracy, Helpfulness, Instruction following, Clarity, Safety), selectable in the sidebar, plus one custom criterion
- Optional reference answer the judge uses to check correctness
- **Position-bias check:** runs the judge twice with A and B swapped, averages the scores, and warns if the winner flips
- Every reply from the model is validated: all criteria must be scored, scores are clamped to 1–5, and the winner must be A, B or tie
- Session history with CSV export of every evaluation
- "Load example" button for a quick demo
- Friendly error messages for a missing or invalid API key, rate limits, network problems and malformed AI output

## Technologies used

- Python 3.10+
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the interface
- [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) via the official `google-genai` SDK
- `python-dotenv` for configuration
- `pytest` for tests (development only)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivanedens55-web/llm-response-evaluator.git
cd llm-response-evaluator
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate    macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a free Gemini API key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```
AI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

The default model is `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`. Set `AI_MODEL` in `.env` to use another one.

## Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Run the tests

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest
```

The tests cover verdict validation and the position-bias logic, and don't call the API.

## How it works

1. `judge.py` builds a grading prompt containing the user's prompt, both responses, the optional reference answer, and the chosen criteria with their descriptions.
2. Gemini is asked to reply in a fixed JSON schema: a score for A and B on each criterion, reasoning, an overall winner and a summary. The temperature is kept low for more consistent judging.
3. The reply is validated before display. Missing criteria, unknown winners or unreadable JSON produce a clear error instead of a misleading verdict.
4. With the position-bias check on, the judge runs a second time with the responses swapped. The second result is mapped back to the original labels, scores are averaged, and the app reports whether the winner held.

## Limitations

An LLM judge can be wrong, inconsistent, or swayed by length and style, so treat its scores as support for human review rather than a final answer. Free-tier usage is rate-limited, and on the free tier Google may use requests to improve its models, so don't paste confidential content.

## Future improvements

- Batch mode: upload a CSV of prompt/response pairs and score them all
- Compare verdicts from two different judge models
- Let users edit criterion descriptions in the UI
